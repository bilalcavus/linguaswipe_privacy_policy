# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: October 11, 2024_

LinguaSwipe (“the app”) is published by Kartlik Team. This policy explains how we handle your information when you use the app.

## Information We Collect

- Account data: The app does not require you to create an account or share personal details to study vocabulary.  
- Usage data: We store your learning progress locally on your device. If you enable cloud backup through your platform provider, the backup is handled by that provider under their own terms.  
- Diagnostic data: Crash reports and performance metrics may be collected by Apple and shared with us in an aggregated form when you opt in to share analytics.

## How We Use Your Information

- To provide core features such as study progress, quiz history, and personalized content.  
- To improve reliability and understand general usage trends through aggregated analytics.  
- To communicate important updates or respond to support requests you initiate.

## Third-Party Services

- **Apple**: Distributes the iOS version of the app and may collect diagnostics and purchase information subject to Apple’s policies.  
- **Flutter & Firebase (optional)**: The app is built with Flutter. Some builds may use Firebase Crashlytics or Analytics when explicitly enabled to identify bugs and improve stability. No personally identifiable information is stored outside the services described above.

## Data Retention and Security

- Learning progress is stored on your device. Deleting the app removes this data.  
- Aggregated analytics from Apple or Firebase are retained only as long as necessary to operate and improve the service.  
- We use industry-standard safeguards to protect any data that is transmitted.

## Your Choices

- You can reset your learning progress from the in-app settings.  
- You can disable optional analytics sharing in your device’s system settings.  
- To request deletion of support conversations or submit privacy questions, contact us using the email below.
